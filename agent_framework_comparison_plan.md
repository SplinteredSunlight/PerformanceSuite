# Comparative Analysis Plan: Current Agent System vs. Google A2A Framework

## 1. Understanding the Current Architecture

From the code review, the current agent system has these key components:

- **SessionManager**: Central coordinator that maintains musical context and coordinates bandmate agents
- **MusicalContext**: Container for musical state (tempo, key, chord progression, etc.)
- **BandmateAgent**: Abstract base class for AI bandmate agents
- **Specialized Agents**: Concrete implementations like DrumsAgent and BassAgent
- **Communication Pattern**: Primarily hub-and-spoke with SessionManager as the hub

The system follows a centralized coordination model where:
1. Audio input is processed by AudioAnalyzer
2. SessionManager updates the MusicalContext
3. Agents receive context updates and generate musical output
4. Output is sent to MIDI generation and animation control

## 2. Understanding Google's A2A Framework

We'll need to research and document the key aspects of Google's A2A framework:

1. **Core Architecture**:
   - Agent definition and capabilities
   - Communication protocols
   - Coordination mechanisms

2. **Key Features**:
   - Agent specialization approach
   - Inter-agent communication patterns
   - Scalability mechanisms
   - Error handling and resilience

3. **Implementation Patterns**:
   - How agents are defined and instantiated
   - How communication is structured
   - How coordination is managed

## 3. Comparative Analysis Framework

We'll analyze both systems across these dimensions:
