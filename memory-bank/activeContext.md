## Current Focus

* Setting up Mac Mini M4 for audio processing (MB-005)
* Setting up Mac Studio M4 for rendering (MB-006)
* Configuring network connectivity between machines (MB-007)
* Implementing task status update feature (MB-019)
* Enhancing AudioInputHandler for Quantum 2626 (optimizing buffer size for <10ms latency)
* Creating audio analysis testing framework
* Enhancing SessionManager implementation
* Developing basic bandmate agents
* Optimizing network communication between Mac Mini and Mac Studio
* Ensuring reliable remote control between machines

## Recent Changes

* Implemented task management system:
  * Created fix_task_management.py script to clean up taskManagement.md file
  * Created update_task_status.py script for easy task status updates
  * Added documentation in scripts/README_task_management.md
  * Fixed issues with duplicate tasks in taskManagement.md
  * Updated task statuses for MB-005, MB-006, and MB-007 to "In Progress"
* Created comprehensive environment setup guide (docs/environment_setup_guide.md)
* Developed test scripts for network connectivity (scripts/test_osc_sender.py, scripts/test_osc_receiver.py)
* Created audio interface test script (scripts/test_audio_analysis.py)
* Made test scripts executable
* Implemented remote control MCP system (scripts/remote_control_mcp.py, scripts/remote_control_client.py)
* Created test script for remote control functionality (scripts/test_remote_control.py)
* Updated requirements.txt to include paramiko for remote control functionality
* Added detailed documentation for remote control system (scripts/README_remote_control.md)
* Added remote-control MCP server configuration to .roo/mcp.json for Roo integration
* Created A2A implementation plan (a2a_implementation_plan.md) for future agent communication system
* Cleaned up project by removing unnecessary test files and directories
* Consolidated redundant scripts (removed simple_remote_setup.py, minimal_remote_setup.py, remote_client.py)
* Created comprehensive scripts/README.md to document script organization and purpose
* Created project_cleanup_plan.md to document the cleanup process

## Open Questions/Issues

* CI/CD pipeline setup - need to determine best approach for local CI/CD
* Testing strategy for core components
* Optimal buffer size settings for Quantum 2626 to achieve <10ms latency
* Game engine selection for rendering machine (Godot vs Unity vs Unreal)
* Integration approach for A2A communication protocols with existing agent system
