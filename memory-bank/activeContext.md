# Active Context: Performance Suite

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-04-16 13:07:00 - Updated to reflect Phase 1 implementation planning with two-machine architecture.
2025-04-16 13:45:00 - Added MCP servers for task management and GitHub Desktop integration.

## Current Focus

* Implementing Phase 1 of the Performance Suite with a two-machine architecture
* Setting up development environments on Mac Mini M4 (16GB) and Mac Studio M4 (64GB)
* Establishing network connectivity between the two machines
* Implementing basic audio analysis pipeline on Machine 1 (Mac Mini)
* Creating simple agent system prototype on Machine 1 (Mac Mini)
* Setting up basic rendering pipeline on Machine 2 (Mac Studio)
* Integrating components across machines with low-latency communication
* Setting up MCP servers for improved workflow and task management

* How will we implement fallback mechanisms if network communication is interrupted?
* What are the specific performance benchmarks for Phase 1 prototypes?
* How will we measure and optimize latency across the distributed system?
* What are the specific capabilities and limitations of Universal Control for development?
* How will we handle audio interface sharing or routing between machines if needed?
* What are the specific performance characteristics of the MCP servers?
* How will the system handle network interruptions or MCP server unavailability?
* What is the expected latency overhead of using MCP servers vs. direct implementation?
* How will the Google ADK bandmate agents communicate with each other?
* What are the authentication and security requirements for MCP server access?
* How will the system handle version compatibility between MCP servers and our application?
