# Testing Strategy: Performance Suite

## Testing Philosophy & Approach

The Performance Suite testing strategy is built on the following core principles:

1. **Performance-First Testing**: Given the real-time nature of the system, performance testing is a first-class concern, not an afterthought.

2. **Multi-Level Testing**: Testing occurs at multiple levels, from unit tests of individual components to end-to-end tests of the complete system.

3. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are integrated into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline, providing immediate feedback.

4. **User-Centered Validation**: Testing includes both objective metrics and subjective evaluation of the user experience.

5. **Test-Driven Development**: Where appropriate, tests are written before implementation to clarify requirements and guide development.

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Overall Coverage Targets

- **Core Components**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Agent Logic**: 85%+ code coverage
- **UI/Control Components**: 75%+ code coverage
- **Integration Points**: 100% coverage of critical paths

### Critical Areas Requiring Comprehensive Testing

1. **Audio Analysis Pipeline**: Must be thoroughly tested for accuracy and performance
2. **Agent Decision Making**: Must be tested for musical coherence and responsiveness
3. **Inter-Machine Communication**: Must be tested for reliability and fault tolerance
4. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Must be tested for timing accuracy and stability

### Coverage Measurement

- Code coverage will be measured using appropriate tools for each language (e.g., pytest-cov for Python, gcov for C++)
- Coverage reports will be generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage trends will be tracked over time to identify areas needing attention

## Unit Testing Patterns

### Component-Specific Testing Approaches

- **Interface Contract Testing**: Verify components adhere to defined interfaces
- **Configuration Testing**: Test with various system configurations

### Integration Test Environments

- **Development Environment**: Local testing with simulated inputs
- **Staging Environment**: Testing with actual hardware but controlled inputs
- **Production-Like Environment**: Testing with full hardware setup

## End-to-End Testing Scenarios

### Core User Journeys

1. **Basic Performance Scenario**:
   - Performer plays instrument
   - System analyzes audio and generates appropriate accompaniment
   - Visual avatars animate in sync with generated music
   - System responds to changes in performer's playing

2. **Control Interface Scenario**:
   - Performer uses control surface to direct virtual bandmates
   - System interprets commands and adjusts musical behavior
   - Visual feedback confirms command reception
   - Musical output reflects the requested changes

3. **Recovery Scenario**:
   - System encounters unexpected input or internal error
   - Error handling mechanisms activate
   - System recovers to stable state
   - Performance continues with minimal disruption

### Test Automation vs. Manual Testing

- **Automated Tests**: Basic functionality, regression testing, performance metrics
- **Manual Tests**: User experience evaluation, subjective quality assessment, exploratory testing
- **Hybrid Approach**: Automated tests with manual verification of critical aspects

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Types

1. **Audio Samples**: Pre-recorded audio clips with various musical characteristics
2. **MIDI Patterns**: Reference patterns for comparison with generated output
3. **Musical Contexts**: Defined musical scenarios (e.g., chord progressions, rhythmic patterns)
4. **Control Sequences**: Simulated performer control inputs
5. **Network Conditions**: Simulated network scenarios for testing communication

### Test Data Organization

- **Test Data Repository**: Centralized storage for all test data
- **Versioning**: Test data versioned alongside code
- **Metadata**: Detailed descriptions of test data characteristics
- **Generation Scripts**: Tools for generating synthetic test data

### Test Data Access

- **Local Cache**: Test data available locally for development
- **CI/CD Integration**: Test data accessible to automated test pipelines
- **Data Subsets**: Smaller datasets for quick tests, comprehensive sets for thorough testing
