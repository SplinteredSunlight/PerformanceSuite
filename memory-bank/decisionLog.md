## Decision: Task Management System Implementation

* **Date**: 2025-04-17
* **Decision**: Implement a robust task management system with scripts to maintain task integrity and simplify status updates.

## Rationale 

* Ensure consistent task tracking in the Memory Bank taskManagement.md file
* Prevent duplicate task entries and formatting issues
* Simplify task status updates with a command-line interface
* Maintain accurate task statistics and board view
* Support the project's transition to a local-only workflow without GitHub.com integration

## Implementation Details

* Created fix_task_management.py script to:
  * Remove duplicate task entries
  * Fix formatting issues
  * Update task board view
  * Calculate accurate task statistics
* Created update_task_status.py script to:
  * Update task statuses via command line
  * Add notes to tasks
  * Automatically clean up the file after updates
  * Display updated task statistics
* Added comprehensive documentation in scripts/README_task_management.md
* Updated task statuses for MB-005, MB-006, and MB-007 to "In Progress"
* Integrated with existing task_manager_mcp.py MCP server
* Ensured compatibility with the Memory Bank system

## Decision: A2A Communication Protocols for Agent System

* **Date**: 2025-04-16
* **Decision**: Adopt A2A-style communication protocols for the agent system to enhance musical interactions between bandmate agents.

## Rationale 

* Enable more sophisticated musical interactions between agents
* Allow agents to communicate musical intentions directly to each other
* Support emergent musical behaviors through agent collaboration
* Improve the naturalness and coherence of generated music
* Maintain compatibility with existing SessionManager for timing and global state

## Implementation Details

* Created comprehensive implementation plan (a2a_implementation_plan.md)
* Defined four implementation phases:
  * Phase 1: Core Message Infrastructure
  * Phase 2: Agent Communication Capabilities
  * Phase 3: Advanced Musical Interactions
  * Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
* Designed hybrid architecture that maintains SessionManager for timing while adding direct agent communication
* Specified message formats and protocols for musical interactions
* Outlined enhancements to BandmateAgent class to support messaging
* Provided example implementations for fill coordination between drums and bass
* Defined success metrics for technical performance and musical quality
* Scheduled as future milestone after completion of two-machine setup

## Decision: Remote Control MCP System

* **Date**: 2025-04-16
* **Decision**: Implement a Remote Control MCP system to enable controlling the Mac Studio (Machine 2) directly from the Mac Mini (Machine 1).

## Rationale 

* Simplify workflow by allowing control of both machines from a single keyboard/mouse
* Provide programmatic control of the rendering machine from the processing machine
* Enable file transfers between machines through a consistent interface
* Allow remote command execution and status monitoring
* Integrate with Roo for seamless control through MCP tools

## Implementation Details

* Created remote control server script (scripts/remote_control_mcp.py) for Mac Studio
* Created remote control client script (scripts/remote_control_client.py) for Mac Mini
* Implemented socket-based communication over port 5000
* Added support for remote command execution, file transfers, and status monitoring
* Created comprehensive test script (scripts/test_remote_control.py)
* Added detailed documentation (scripts/README_remote_control.md)
* Updated environment setup guide with remote control instructions
* Added paramiko dependency to requirements.txt for SSH functionality
* Added remote-control MCP server configuration to .roo/mcp.json with tools for:
  * remote_execute - Execute commands on the Mac Studio
  * remote_transfer - Transfer files to/from the Mac Studio
  * remote_status - Get system status from the Mac Studio

## Decision: Two-Machine Architecture and Connectivity

* **Date**: 2025-04-16
* **Decision**: Implement a two-machine architecture with Universal Control for keyboard/mouse/display sharing and direct Ethernet connection for network communication.

## Rationale 

* Separate processing concerns: audio processing on Machine 1, rendering on Machine 2
* Achieve optimal performance for both audio processing and visual rendering
* Minimize latency between machines with direct Ethernet connection
* Simplify user experience with seamless keyboard/mouse/display sharing
* Leverage Apple's Universal Control for native integration between Mac devices

## Implementation Details

* Created comprehensive environment setup guide (docs/environment_setup_guide.md)
* Configured static IP addresses for both machines (192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.20)
* Selected Universal Control as primary keyboard/mouse/display sharing solution
* Provided Barrier as alternative option if Universal Control is insufficient
* Developed test scripts for network connectivity (scripts/test_osc_sender.py, scripts/test_osc_receiver.py)
* Created audio interface test script (scripts/test_audio_analysis.py)
* Established OSC over UDP as primary communication protocol between machines
* Defined port assignments for different types of messages (8000-8003)

## Decision: Remove GitHub.com Integration

* **Date**: 2025-04-16
* **Decision**: Remove GitHub.com integration scripts and workflows while maintaining GitHub Desktop functionality for local Git operations.

## Rationale 

* Simplify the project architecture by focusing on local-only workflow
* Reduce external dependencies on GitHub.com services
* Maintain local task management through Memory Bank and task manager MCP
* Keep GitHub Desktop MCP for local Git operations
* Preserve reference copies of workflows for future CI/CD implementation

## Implementation Details

* Created backup of GitHub workflows in `.github_reference/` directory
* Removed GitHub.com integration scripts:
  * `sync_memory_bank_to_github.py`
  * `sync_github_issues_to_memory_bank.py`
  * `setup_github_project*.py` scripts
  * `run_memory_bank_to_github_sync.sh`
  * `run_memory_bank_sync.sh`
  * `update_task_status.py`
* Removed GitHub.com-specific documentation
* Created new `local_only_workflow.md` documentation
* Updated Memory Bank to reflect changes
* Kept GitHub Desktop MCP (`github_desktop_mcp.py`) for local Git operations
* Kept task manager MCP (`task_manager_mcp.py`) for local task management
* Kept dashboard for task visualization
