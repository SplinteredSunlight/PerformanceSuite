# Decision Log: Performance Suite

This document tracks significant architectural and technical decisions made during the development of the Performance Suite project.

## [2025-04-15 20:08:23] - GitHub Project Management Setup

**Decision**: Implemented comprehensive GitHub Project management configuration with custom fields, views, automation, and milestone tracking.

**Context**: The project needed a structured approach to task management and progress tracking as it transitions from planning to implementation phase.

**Rationale**:
- GitHub Projects provides a flexible, integrated solution for task management
- Custom fields allow for better categorization and prioritization of tasks
- Multiple views enable different perspectives on project progress
- Automation reduces manual work and ensures consistent project management
- Milestone tracking helps with roadmap planning and progress visualization

**Implementation**:
- Created project configuration with custom fields (Priority, Component, Effort)
- Set up multiple project views (Board, Roadmap, Component, Priority)
- Implemented automation workflows for issue and PR management
- Created milestone configuration and synchronization
- Added specialized issue templates for technical debt and performance optimization
- Developed a setup script to facilitate project configuration

**Implications**:
- Improved task organization and visibility
- More efficient project management workflow
- Better tracking of project progress against milestones
- Enhanced ability to prioritize and categorize work
- Consistent approach to issue and PR management
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

## [2025-04-15 18:35:00] - Project Organization and Documentation Consolidation

**Decision**: Consolidated technical documentation into a single comprehensive document and reorganized project structure.

**Context**: The project contained multiple technical specification documents with overlapping information, and utility files were scattered across different directories.

**Rationale**:
- Multiple technical specification documents (Technical Specifications.md, comprehensive-technical-spec-CLAUDE.md, PerformanceSuite_Documentation_Bundle) created confusion about the authoritative source of information
- Schema files and utility tools were located in a documentation bundle rather than in appropriate code directories
- A cleaner project structure was needed as we transition from planning to implementation phase

**Implementation**:
- Created a consolidated technical specification document in docs/technical_specification.md
- Moved schema files to src/schemas/ directory for better organization
- Relocated utility tools to scripts/ directory
- Updated README.md to reflect the new project structure
- Removed redundant documentation files to streamline the project

**Implications**:
- Single source of truth for technical specifications
- Improved project organization with files in logical locations
- Better developer experience with clearer project structure
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Simplified maintenance of documentation

## [2025-04-15 17:05:00] - Incorporation of Comprehensive Technical Specification

**Decision**: Incorporated the comprehensive technical specification document into the Memory Bank.

**Context**: A detailed technical specification document was provided with extensive information about system architecture, performance requirements, hardware specifications, MCP server integration, and testing procedures.

**Rationale**:
- The specification provides much more detailed technical information than what was previously in the Memory Bank
- It includes specific latency requirements (sub-10ms end-to-end)
- It details the MCP server integration which wasn't previously documented
- It provides comprehensive information about network configuration, error handling, and monitoring

**Implementation**:
- Updated `techContext.md` with detailed hardware/software architecture and configuration information
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` with the more detailed architecture diagram and MCP server integration
- Enhanced `testingStrategy.md` with specific testing procedures and performance benchmarks
- Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect the incorporation of the specification

**Implications**:
- The project now has much more specific technical requirements, especially regarding latency
- MCP server integration is now a formal part of the architecture
- Performance benchmarks are more clearly defined
- Testing procedures are more comprehensive

## [2025-04-15 17:00:00] - Initial Memory Bank Setup

**Decision**: Created the initial Memory Bank structure with core documentation files.

**Context**: The project needed a centralized knowledge repository to maintain context and track decisions.

**Rationale**:
- Centralized documentation improves knowledge sharing
- Structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage of project aspects
- Memory Bank provides continuity across development sessions

**Implementation**:
- Created core Memory Bank files (productContext, systemPatterns, techContext, etc.)
- Established initial project vision and architecture
- Documented technical requirements and constraints

**Implications**:
- Provides foundation for project development
- Establishes common understanding of project goals and architecture
- Creates framework for tracking project evolution
