## Decision: Implement MCP Servers for Task Management and GitHub Desktop

* **Date**: 2025-04-16
* **Decision Maker**: Development Team
* **Status**: Implemented

## Rationale

* Streamline task management workflow by allowing direct interaction with the Memory Bank taskManagement.md file from within Roo
* Enable Git operations directly from Roo without having to switch to GitHub Desktop or command line
* Improve developer productivity by reducing context switching between tools
* Leverage MCP server capabilities to enhance the development workflow
* Provide a foundation for future MCP server integrations with other tools

## Implementation Details

* Created two MCP servers:
  1. **Task Manager MCP Server**: Provides tools for managing tasks in the Memory Bank taskManagement.md file
     * list_tasks: Lists all tasks, optionally filtered by status or component
     * create_task: Creates a new task with specified details
     * update_task: Updates an existing task's status or details
     * get_task_statistics: Gets statistics about tasks (total, completed, etc.)
  
  2. **GitHub Desktop MCP Server**: Provides tools for Git operations
     * git_status: Shows the current Git status
     * git_commit: Commits changes with a message
     * git_push: Pushes commits to remote repository
     * git_pull: Pulls changes from remote repository
     * git_branch: Creates or switches branches

* Implemented as Python scripts:
  * scripts/task_manager_mcp.py
  * scripts/github_desktop_mcp.py

* Configured in both project-specific (.roo/mcp.json) and global MCP settings
* Created documentation in docs/mcp_task_github_integration.md

## Alternatives Considered

* **Manual Task Management**: Continue manually editing taskManagement.md
  * Rejected due to lower productivity and higher chance of formatting errors
  
* **GitHub Web Interface**: Use GitHub web interface for Git operations
  * Rejected due to need for context switching and browser dependencies
  
* **Command Line Git**: Use Git directly from command line
  * Rejected in favor of more user-friendly interface through MCP tools

## Future Considerations

* Potential integration with other tools like Blender and Ableton
* Enhancements to task management with additional features like task dependencies visualization
* Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
* Performance optimizations for larger repositories and task lists
