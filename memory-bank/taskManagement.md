# Task Management: Performance Suite

## GitHub Project Structure

The Performance Suite project will use GitHub Projects for task management and progress tracking. The project board structure will be organized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph GitHub Repository
        Issues[Issues]
        PRs[Pull Requests]
        Actions[GitHub Actions]
        Projects[GitHub Projects]
    end
    
    subgraph Project Board
        Backlog[Backlog]
        ToDo[To Do]
        InProgress[In Progress]
        Review[Review]
        Done[Done]
    end
    
    subgraph Issue Types
        Feature[Feature Request]
        Bug[Bug Report]
        Refactor[Refactoring]
        Doc[Documentation]
        Research[Research Spike]
    end
    
    Issues --> Project Board
    PRs --> Review
```

### Board Columns

1. **Backlog**:
   - Captured ideas and tasks not yet ready for implementation
   - Needs refinement before moving to To Do
   - May contain tasks for future milestones

2. **To Do**:
   - Fully specified tasks ready for implementation
   - Prioritized according to current milestone goals
   - Contains all tasks planned for current sprint

3. **In Progress**:
   - Tasks actively being worked on
   - Limited to avoid context switching (typically 1-2 per developer)
   - Should include link to branch/PR if applicable

4. **Review**:
   - Tasks completed and awaiting review
   - Includes code review, documentation review, or design review
   - May require testing or validation before approval

5. **Done**:
   - Tasks that have been completed and approved
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - Documentation updated as needed

## Task Prioritization Framework

Tasks will be prioritized using the following framework:

### Priority Levels

1. **P0: Critical**
   - Blocking issues preventing project progress
   - Core functionality essential for system operation
   - Immediate attention required

2. **P1: High**
   - Important features for upcoming milestone
   - Significant bugs affecting system functionality
   - Required for demo or review

3. **P2: Medium**
   - Standard feature implementation
   - Non-blocking bugs
   - Improvements to existing functionality

4. **P3: Low**
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Minor improvements
   - Documentation updates

### Effort Estimation

Tasks will be estimated using T-shirt sizing:

- **XS**: < 4 hours
- **S**: 4-8 hours (1 day)
- **M**: 1-3 days
- **L**: 3-5 days
- **XL**: 5-10 days
- **XXL**: > 10 days (should be broken down)

### Prioritization Matrix

```
┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             │               IMPORTANCE                  │

│             │     High      │           Low             │
├─────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│     High    │ Do First      │ Schedule for              │
│ URGENCY     │ (P0, P1)      │ specific time (P2)        │
├─────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│     Low     │ Schedule for  │ Do when time              │
│             │ near term (P2)│ permits (P3)              │
