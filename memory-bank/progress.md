## What Works

The project is in the initial development phase. The following foundational elements have been established:

1. **Comprehensive Technical Specification**: Detailed technical requirements including:
   - Specific latency budgets (sub-10ms end-to-end)
   - Detailed hardware specifications for both machines
   - MCP server integration architecture
   - Network configuration and protocols
   - Error handling and recovery procedures
   - Testing methodologies and performance benchmarks

2. **Project Vision and Goals**: Defined in the project brief and product context documents
3. **Detailed Architecture**: Two-machine design with specialized components and MCP server integration
4. **Technical Requirements**: Precise latency constraints and system requirements
5. **Memory Bank**: Comprehensive documentation structure for project knowledge management
6. **GitHub Repository**: Set up with issue templates, PR template, CI workflow, and contributing guidelines
7. **GitHub Projects**: Configured with custom fields, views, automation workflows, and milestone tracking
8. **Development Environment**: Basic project structure with core components implemented
9. **Component Prototypes**: Initial implementations of:
   - Audio Analysis: Basic feature extraction from audio input
   - Agent System: Session manager and bandmate agents (drums, bass)
   - MIDI Generation: Conversion of agent output to MIDI messages
   - Animation Control: Communication with rendering machine

## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, several technical challenges and risks have been identified:

1. **Latency Management**: Achieving the required end-to-end latency of <10ms across multiple processing stages
2. **Inter-Machine Synchronization**: Ensuring tight synchronization between audio and visual elements
3. **Resource Constraints**: Balancing computational demands with available resources
4. **Integration Complexity**: Managing the integration of multiple specialized components
5. **MCP Server Performance**: Ensuring MCP servers meet the sub-1ms processing time requirements
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Implementing effective fallback mechanisms for all system components
