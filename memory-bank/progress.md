## What Works

The project is in the initial development phase. The following foundational elements have been established:

1. **Project Vision and Goals**: Defined in the project brief and product context documents
2. **High-Level Architecture**: Two-machine design with specialized components
3. **Technical Requirements**: Latency constraints and system requirements
4. **Memory Bank**: Comprehensive documentation structure for project knowledge management
5. **GitHub Repository**: Set up with issue templates, PR template, CI workflow, and contributing guidelines
6. **Development Environment**: Basic project structure with core components implemented
7. **Component Prototypes**: Initial implementations of:
   - Audio Analysis: Basic feature extraction from audio input
   - Agent System: Session manager and bandmate agents (drums, bass)
   - MIDI Generation: Conversion of agent output to MIDI messages
   - Animation Control: Communication with rendering machine

## What's Left to Build

The entire system implementation is pending. Major components to be built include:

### Machine 1: Processing & Audio
- [x] Audio Analysis Agent
- [ ] Session Manager Agent
- [ ] Control Interface Agent
- [ ] Bandmate Agents (Drums, Bass, etc.)
- [ ] MIDI Generation Agent
- [ ] Animation Control Agent
- [ ] Stage Visuals Agent (Optional)
- [ ] Ableton Live Integration

### Machine 2: Rendering
- [ ] OSC/WebSocket Listener
- [ ] Scene Manager
- [ ] Avatar Loader
- [ ] Animation State Machine/Player
- [ ] Shape Key Controller
- [ ] Real-time Renderer

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] Inter-Machine Communication Protocol
- [ ] Configuration System
- [ ] Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Testing Framework
- [ ] Deployment Pipeline

## Implementation Timeline

The project is in the initial planning phase, and a detailed implementation timeline has not yet been established. A preliminary roadmap is as follows:

1. **Phase 1: Core Architecture and Prototypes** (Timeline TBD)
   - Establish development environment
   - Implement basic audio analysis pipeline
   - Create simple agent system prototype
   - Set up basic rendering pipeline

2. **Phase 2: Component Development** (Timeline TBD)
   - Implement individual agents
   - Develop rendering system
   - Create animation control system
   - Establish inter-machine communication

3. **Phase 3: Integration and Optimization** (Timeline TBD)
   - Integrate all components
   - Optimize for latency and performance
   - Implement configuration system
   - Develop monitoring and debugging tools

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement** (Timeline TBD)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - User experience refinement
   - Performance tuning
   - Documentation completion

## Known Issues

As the project is in the planning phase, there are no implementation issues yet. However, several technical challenges and risks have been identified:

1. **Latency Management**: Achieving the required end-to-end latency across multiple processing stages
2. **Inter-Machine Synchronization**: Ensuring tight synchronization between audio and visual elements
3. **Resource Constraints**: Balancing computational demands with available resources
4. **Integration Complexity**: Managing the integration of multiple specialized components

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As this is the initial setup of the Memory Bank, there is no history of decision evolution yet. This section will track significant changes in project direction, technical approaches, and architectural decisions as the project progresses.

### Initial Architectural Decisions
- Two-machine architecture to separate processing and rendering concerns
- Agent-based design for modularity and specialization
- OSC/WebSocket for inter-machine communication
- Ableton Live as the sound generation engine
- Game engine for visual rendering

## Next Milestones

1. **Complete System Architecture**: Finalize component relationships and interfaces
2. **Development Environment Setup**: Establish toolchain and workflow
3. **Initial Prototype**: Develop proof-of-concept for core functionality
4. **Testing Framework**: Create benchmarking and validation tools
