# Project Brief: Performance Suite

## Overview
The Performance Suite is a comprehensive system designed for live musical performances, integrating audio processing, MIDI generation, and visual components. The system enables real-time interaction between a human performer and AI-driven virtual bandmates, creating an immersive audio-visual performance experience.

## Core Requirements

1. **Two-Machine Architecture**:
   - Machine 1: Processing & Audio (e.g., Mac Mini M4/Pro)
   - Machine 2: Rendering (e.g., High-End Mac/Nvidia PC)

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Real-time audio analysis
   - MIDI generation for Ableton Live
   - Support for professional audio interfaces (e.g., Quantum 2626)

3. **AI Bandmates**:
   - Multiple agent types (Drums, Bass, etc.)
   - Responsive to performer input
   - Contextually aware musical generation

4. **Visual Components**:
   - Real-time avatar animations
   - Stage visuals
   - Optional DMX lighting control

5. **Control Interface**:
   - Support for MIDI/OSC control surfaces
   - Intuitive performer command system

## Project Goals

1. Create a seamless performance environment where human performers can interact with AI bandmates
2. Ensure low-latency response for real-time musical interaction
3. Provide high-quality visual representation of AI bandmates
4. Support professional audio workflows and equipment
5. Enable flexible configuration for different performance scenarios

## Success Criteria

1. System latency under acceptable thresholds for musical performance
2. Stable operation during extended performance sessions
3. Intuitive control interface requiring minimal performer attention
4. Convincing musical generation from AI bandmates
5. Visually engaging avatar animations synchronized with audio
