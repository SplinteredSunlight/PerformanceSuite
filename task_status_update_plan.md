# Task Status Update Plan

## Current Status

Based on the task management system and dashboard:

- Tasks MB-001, MB-002, and MB-003 are marked as "Completed"
- All other tasks are marked as "Not Started"
- No tasks are currently marked as "In Progress"

## Task Sequence and Dependencies

The task sequence based on dependencies is:

1. ✅ MB-001: Create initial project structure
2. ✅ MB-002: Establish Memory Bank for project documentation
3. ✅ MB-003: Implement MCP servers for task management and GitHub Desktop
4. MB-004: Create local frontend for task visualization (depends on MB-003)
5. MB-005: Set up Mac Mini M4 for audio processing (no dependencies)
6. MB-006: Set up Mac Studio M4 for rendering (no dependencies)
7. MB-007: Configure network connectivity between machines (depends on MB-005, MB-006)
8. MB-008: Implement OSC communication (depends on MB-007)
9. MB-009: Enhance AudioInputHandler for Quantum 2626 (depends on MB-005)

## Next Steps

Based on the dependencies and project phases, the next steps should be:

1. Start working on MB-005 (Set up Mac Mini M4 for audio processing) and mark it as "In Progress"
2. In parallel, start working on MB-006 (Set up Mac Studio M4 for rendering) and mark it as "In Progress"
3. Once MB-005 is completed, start working on MB-009 (Enhance AudioInputHandler for Quantum 2626)

## Task Status Update Commands

To update the task status using the task manager MCP, we can use the following commands:

```bash
# Mark MB-005 as In Progress
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tool":"update_task","params":{"task_id":"MB-005","status":"In Progress","notes":"Starting setup of Mac Mini M4 for audio processing"}}' http://localhost:8000/mcp/task_manager

# Mark MB-006 as In Progress
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tool":"update_task","params":{"task_id":"MB-006","status":"In Progress","notes":"Starting setup of Mac Studio M4 for rendering"}}' http://localhost:8000/mcp/task_manager
```

## Dashboard Verification

After updating the task status, we should verify that the changes are reflected in the dashboard by:

1. Refreshing the dashboard in the browser
2. Checking that MB-005 and MB-006 appear in the "In Progress" section
3. Verifying that the task statistics are updated accordingly
