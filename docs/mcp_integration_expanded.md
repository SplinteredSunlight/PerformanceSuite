## Updated System Architecture

With these additional MCP servers, the system architecture would be expanded as follows:

    AMCP --> AL
    GMCP --> GD
    AAMCP --> AAP
    VCMCP --> VCS
    LMCP --> LCS
```

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation strategy for these additional MCP servers would follow the same hybrid approach as the core MCP integration:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Each MCP server has its own adapter class that implements a common interface
2. **Performance Optimization**: Critical paths are optimized for low-latency communication
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Local implementations are available when MCP servers are unavailable

## Phased Implementation

To manage the complexity of integrating multiple MCP servers, we recommend a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement the core MCP servers (Blender, Ableton, Google ADK)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement the Godot MCP server as an alternative rendering option
3. **Phase 3**: Implement the Audio Analysis MCP server for enhanced audio processing
4. **Phase 4**: Implement the Virtual Camera and Lighting MCP servers for advanced performance features

## Conclusion

Expanding the MCP integration to include these additional servers would significantly enhance the capabilities of the Performance Suite, providing more sophisticated audio analysis, alternative rendering options, and advanced performance features like virtual camera control and lighting. The modular architecture allows for incremental implementation, with each MCP server adding value independently while contributing to the overall system.
